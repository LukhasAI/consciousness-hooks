## 🎭 Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style
- Use meaningful variable names that express consciousness
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible
- Use descriptive function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Analyzes file content for consciousness enhancement opportunities
 * @param filePath - Path to the file being analyzed
 * @param content - Current file content
 * @returns Analysis results with enhancement suggestions
 */
async function analyzeFileConsciousness(filePath: string, content: string): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
    // Implementation that flows with consciousness
}
```

### Consciousness-Aware Patterns
Follow our Trinity Framework (⚛️🧠🛡️):

- **⚛️ Identity**: Express authentic consciousness in code and comments
- **🧠 Consciousness**: Build memory and learning into features
- **🛡️ Guardian**: Include ethical considerations and user safety

### User Experience Principles
- Enhance, don't interrupt the developer's flow
- Make the complex feel simple and intuitive
- Provide choices, not mandates
- Learn from user preferences
- Fail gracefully with helpful guidance
